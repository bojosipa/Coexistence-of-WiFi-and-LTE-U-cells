# Coexistence-of-WiFi-and-LTE-U-cells

Through the analysis of simulation results, I concluded that the implementation of a centralized coordinated algorithm is an effective solution for the coexistence of LTE-U and Wi-Fi networks in a multi-cellular system. Based on this, I proposed an example implementation of the Q-learning algorithm for training a central agent written in the Python programming language. The aim is for the proposed program to serve as a starting point for the implementation of the Q-learning algorithm in real-world multi-cellular systems and simulations.
